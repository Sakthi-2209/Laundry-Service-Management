# Laundry-Service-Management
This project is a full-stack web application for managing laundry services, built with React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend REST API. It allows customers to place orders for laundry pickup and delivery, and enables admins or laundry staff to track orders, update statuses, and manage services efficiently.
